# Threejs-VR-Hipparcos (under construction)

Explore Hipparcos Catalogue of 119,617 stars with Threejs VR.

# Hardware

Oculus Quest recommended (required 6DOF headset/controllers).<br>

# Software

Oculus Browser (Oculus Quest Firmware update 12.0 or later).

# Installation

No installation. In Oculus Quest, open Oculus Browser and go to link:



Our Solar System is the green box. See ~8000 stars within 50.0 parsec (how to plot 119,617 stars on a mobile VR device).

Oculus Quest's headset 6DOF tracking works but no controllers (keep code simple, solve how to move around stars on a mobile VR device).
